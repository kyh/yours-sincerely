## ðŸ‘‰ Get Started

The application follows a typical [Remix](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/tutorials/blog) folder structure. You can find the entry point the web application in the `app` directory. I'll be moving the native app code in here soon(ish).

You'll notice that the Remix routes are just thin wrappers and most of the heavy lifting code is done in the `/lib` directory. This follows more of a [nx](https://nx.dev/getting-started/intro)/[turborepo](https://turborepo.org/)/[flutter](https://flutter.dev/) folder structure which helps compartmentalize feature specific code and encourages sharing business logic code between the frontend web, server, and react native apps.

```
â”œâ”€â”€ /api                     # Remix server
â”œâ”€â”€ /app                     # Web client
|   â”œâ”€â”€ /lib                 # Feature source code (most of the logic lives here)
|   â””â”€â”€ /routes              # Remix file sytem routes
â”œâ”€â”€ /prisma                  # Prisma schema and database associated files
â”œâ”€â”€ /public                  # Static assets
â””â”€â”€ /styles                  # Global styles
```

### Install dependencies

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - LTS version recommended
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) - [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to run multi containers locally

### Local Development

```sh
# Rename .env.example to .env and update variables
mv .env.example .env

# Installing dependencies
npm install

# Start a docker container containing your local database
npm run docker:start

# Run db migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Seed your database
npm run db:seed

# To start the apps
npm run dev
```

This will start the [Remix](https://remix.run) development server. When the above command completes you'll be able to view your website at `http://localhost:3000`
