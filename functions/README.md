# Firebase backend functions

This folder contains a little backend code for updating our search index when a post changes and updating the number of likes on each post, etc.

**[Documentation for Firebase Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/)**

## Setting environment variables

Before running backend functions, you have to give Firebase your secret API keys. This can be done manually using the [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/config-env).
